# contributing guide

hey there, thanks for stopping by.

if you want to contribute, awesome — just keep things simple, clean, and easy to follow.

## writing style

* use clear and simple english
* no gen z slang, no internet lingo
* express your thoughts fully, but don’t ramble
* avoid sounding arrogant or overly formal
* lowercase everything, including commit messages

## commit rules

we use rebase merging. keep your commit history clean and meaningful.

use this format:

* `fix:` for bug fixes
* `feat:` for new features
* `add:` for small improvements or minor additions
* `chore:` for breaking changes or dependency updates
* `remove:` for removing broken or unused code

example:

```
feat: add image upload to chat feature
fix: correct typo in menu logic
chore: update all tailwind packages
```

## pull requests

* open pull requests only when ready
* if it’s urgent or critical, feel free to **mention me**
* otherwise, i might close it if it sits too long
* make sure your branch is rebased before opening a pr

thanks for keeping it clean ✌️
