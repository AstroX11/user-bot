# security policy

hey, if you spot any security issue — thanks in advance for helping out.

## how to report

please don’t open a public issue for security stuff. instead, email me directly at:

**[devastro0010@gmail.com](mailto:devastro0010@gmail.com)**

include as much detail as you can:

* what the issue is
* how to reproduce it
* anything else that helps

i’ll try to respond within a few days. if it’s a real problem, i’ll fix it as soon as possible.

## how you can help

* report issues privately
* don’t exploit or share them while it’s being fixed
* if you can suggest or test a fix, even better
* be respectful — we’re all trying to make things better

thanks for keeping things safe.

let me know if you want to add things like pgp, bounty info, or version support later.
