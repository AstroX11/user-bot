# code of conduct

hey, welcome.

this project is open to everyone. we want it to feel safe, respectful, and kind — no matter who you are or where you’re from.

## what we expect

just be cool. here’s what that means:

* be kind and respectful
* listen before reacting
* feedback is great, but keep it thoughtful and constructive
* admit mistakes when they happen, learn from them
* care about the community, not just your own ideas

## what’s not okay

don’t do any of this:

* sexual stuff, offensive jokes, or creepy behavior
* bullying, trolling, or personal attacks
* harassing anyone — publicly or privately
* posting people’s private info without permission
* anything that makes others feel unsafe or unwelcome

## handling problems

if something crosses the line, we’ll step in. we may:

* edit or remove stuff
* give you a heads-up
* ban you if it keeps happening

we’ll try to be fair and explain why when we take action.

## where this applies

this code covers all spaces tied to this project — code, issues, pull requests, chats, and even outside platforms if you’re clearly representing the project.

## if you need help

you can reach out at:

**[devastro0010@gmail.com](mailto:devastro0010@gmail.com)**

we’ll treat all reports seriously and respectfully. we won’t share your name unless you say it’s okay.

## what happens if something goes wrong

here’s how we deal with issues:

**1. heads-up**
you might get a private message if your behavior wasn’t okay. usually, that’s enough.

**2. warning**
if it continues, we’ll send a warning. you’ll need to step back for a bit.

**3. temporary ban**
if it gets serious, we’ll ban you temporarily from any interaction.

**4. permanent ban**
if the behavior keeps happening or is harmful enough, you’re out — permanently.
